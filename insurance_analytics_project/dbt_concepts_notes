The 5 dbt Materializations (ONE by ONE)


View → Table → Incremental → Ephemeral → Snapshot

1️⃣ VIEW — “Calculate every time”
Chai Stall Example ☕

You DO NOT write totals in notebook.
Every time someone asks:

“How much profit today?”

You recalculate from scratch:

Count cups

Multiply price

Subtract cost

In dbt

A VIEW does NOT store data

It runs the SQL every time you query

Memory Trick 🧠

VIEW = Lazy student
Never writes notes, recalculates in exam

When to use

✔ Small data
✔ Light transformations
✔ Early layers (Bronze / Silver)

2️⃣ TABLE — “Calculate once, save it”
Chai Stall Example ☕

At end of day:

You calculate profit

Write it in notebook

Tomorrow, you just read it

In dbt

A TABLE stores results physically

Faster to read

Takes storage

Memory Trick 🧠

TABLE = Toppers notebook
Writes once, revises many times

When to use

✔ Large data
✔ Final reporting
✔ Gold layer / BI layer

3️⃣ INCREMENTAL — “Only add new stuff” ⭐ VERY IMPORTANT
Chai Stall Example ☕

You already wrote profit till yesterday.

Today:

You ONLY add today’s sales

You DO NOT recalculate old days

In dbt

Processes only new rows

Uses where created_date > max_date

Memory Trick 🧠

INCREMENTAL = Smart student
Doesn’t rewrite whole notebook
Adds only today’s homework

When to use

✔ Huge tables (millions of rows)
✔ Daily data loads
✔ Fact tables

4️⃣ EPHEMERAL — “Temporary calculation (no storage)”
Chai Stall Example ☕

You calculate:

“Milk cost per cup”

But:

You don’t write it

You just use it while calculating profit

Then forget it

In dbt

No table

No view

SQL is injected into another model

Memory Trick 🧠

EPHEMERAL = Mental math
Calculate → use → forget

When to use

✔ Small logic
✔ Reusable calculations
✔ Avoid clutter

5️⃣ SNAPSHOT — “History of changes” 📸
Chai Stall Example ☕

Customer Ramesh:

Yesterday: buys 2 cups

Today: buys 5 cups

You want:

“What was his buying habit BEFORE?”

So you take photos of his record over time

In dbt

Tracks changes in rows

Stores old + new values

Used for Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

Memory Trick 🧠

SNAPSHOT = Photo album
Old memories never lost 📷

When to use

✔ Customer data
✔ Address changes
✔ Status changes

ONE SUPER TABLE (Never Forget This)
dbt Type	Real Life	Stores Data?	Recalculates?
View	Recount sales	❌ No	✅ Yes
Table	Written notebook	✅ Yes	❌ No
Incremental	Add today only	✅ Yes	⚠ Partial
Ephemeral	Mental math	❌ No	✅ Yes
Snapshot	Photo album	✅ Yes	❌ No
GOLDEN RULE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Bronze / Silver → View + Ephemeral
Gold → Table / Incremental
History → Snapshot

ONE LAST SUPER MEMORY TRICK

View = Recalculate
Table = Save once
Incremental = Add new
Ephemeral = Temporary
Snapshot = History
